== Description ==

WordPress 3.0 came out with a new default theme: Twenty Ten. The theme is compared to Kubrick an improvement, but still has mostly the same accessibility issues as its forerunner, e.g. not enough contrast in colors, few improvements for keyboard users and you get no real information about user’s location within a web page.

This is where Accessible 1.0 get’s into: a child theme for the default theme Twenty Ten to get the parent theme more accessible. Accessible TwentyTen is equipped with features as:

# Accessible colors and contrast according to  WCAG AAA
# Accessible and visible link focus for keyboard use
# Optimized link hover and active states
# Skip link to content visible on keyboard focus
# Added skip links back to top after content and after footer area
# Added additional hidden headlines for sidebars (left and bottom)
# Navigation "Home" translated for german users into "Startseite"
# Customization of WordPress edtitor TinyMCE
# Translation ready (english and german included)
