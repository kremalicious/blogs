INSTALLATION
Upload the theme to your wordpress 'themes' directory. Login to your theme and select 'Gigantic'.

USAGE
* Please bear in mind that this theme does not support the use of widgets
* To create an archive, login to the theme and create a new page using the 'Archives' template. Remember to leave the page blank

The theme makes use of the following, so they should be completed:
* The author's name
* The blog tagline
* Category descriptions
* Excerpts

The theme will function perfectly well without these bits of information, but it will look better with them.
