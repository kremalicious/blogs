PLEASE NOTE that I will NOT help you customize the theme for your personal pleasure. If you have made edits in the theme and it stops working try reinstalling it or revert the changes. I simply don't have the time to go through pages of code to figure out what you did wrong.

If the design start to look weird even if you haven't touched the code one common mistake is that you have pasted text directly from a program like Word. A LOT crappy code will follow when you do, so either copy it from Word to Notepad and then into the blog, or use the function to paste Word text in the editor.

If you have problems please check the Wordpress FAQ first since it might not be the theme that is the problem.

Thank you for downloading.
