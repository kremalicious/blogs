Infogram lets you quickly and easily create interactive and responsive data visualizations

== Description ==

Infogram is the data visualization tool that brings out the best in your data. Our charts and infographics are easy to make, quick to share, and visually striking. They are interactive and responsive, which allows you to share a wealth of data in a concise manner across platforms.

Infogram is used by journalists, civic leaders and the business community to create visually appealing  data visualizations and embed them for publication on any site. 

We offer a wide range of high-quality template designs and visually-balanced pre-set colors, making data visualization fast and easy, so you can focus on the data while we handle the design.
