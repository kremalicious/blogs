UPGRADING: IMPORTANT NOTE

If you are upgrading from mod_proxy_html 2.x (or 1.x), you will need
some new configuration.  You can Include proxy_html.conf from this
bundle in your httpd.conf (or apache.conf) to use Version 3 as a
drop-in replacement for Version 2.


WINDOWS USERS:

You may need to install some prerequisite libraries before you can
load mod_proxy_html into apache.  If you don't already have them,
see the README at
