###### InuiTypes Support Guide - for most common issues users encountered ######

Issue no.1: IMAGES ARE NOT SHOWING UP
   - check if your ‘cache’ folder in InuiTypes theme files is writing protected - CHMOD your cache folder if that is the case or
	 contact you hosting provider and ask them to chmod it for you. Also google 'chmod via ftp' and find
	 a bit info yourself.
   - You MUST upload images to your blog, images hosted on other locations cannot be resized (ie. hosted on flickr, photobucket,...)   
   
###### InuiTypes Installation Guide ######

**** Theme Activation ****

   > After you activate theme in WP Themes go to InuiTypes Options and set it up by your own taste.
   > Default theme options become active after your first 'Save changes' click so don't get scared if
     theme doesn't look normal after your first WP theme activation =)
   > If you are updating theme from previous version, delete all theme files and upload new ones,
     settings will remain the SAME! - THIS DOESN'T APPLY IF YOU'RE UPGRADING TO VERSION 1.2, PREVIOUS
	 SETTING WILL BE LOST.
	 
**** Exclude Pages from Header Menu ****

   > Check all pages you want to exclude from top header menu
   > If you exclude parent page, child pages will also be excluded as all child
     pages are shown in 4-level drop down menu

**** About Your Blog ****

   > Write something about your blog here. Choose your words wisely and write only what is relevant to your blog content
     as this is very important part of your blog SEO
   > This section will be visible on top of your front page

**** Featured Post Entries ****

   > Featured entries are not categorized like in Igloo theme, instead number of
     featured entries you choose will be the number of highlighted posts you
	 last posted on your blog (sounds complicated but its very simple=)

**** Auto Image Resizing ****

   > When you are creating a post upload image you want to see in featured box, front, archives
     and in single posts afterwards
   > Copy the full path to image and paste it in Custom Image Location, in post editing custom setting
   > That is it!
   > If you encounter any issues with images not showing up, you should check if your ‘cache’ folder 
     in InuiTypes theme files is writing protected - CHMOD your cache folder to 777 if that is the case or
	 contact you hosting provider and ask them to chmod it for you. Also google 'chmod via ftp' and find
	 a bit info yourself.
